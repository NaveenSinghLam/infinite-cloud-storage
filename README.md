# infinite-cloud-storage
Infinite cloud storage, written in python, utilising Discord servers for file storage.
There are most likely still bugs, I will update over the coming weeks.
Instructions in the main .py file. 
Easy to use via a GUI. 
Inspired by DvorakDwarf's Infinite Storage Glitch, but my version uses Discord and implements a GUI to upload, download or delete files.
