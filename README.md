# Infinite Cloud Storage
### Description
 - Infinite cloud storage utilises Discord servers for file storage. It also has a GUI to upload, download or delete files.
 - There are most likely still bugs, I will update over the coming weeks.
 - Inspired by DvorakDwarf's Infinite Storage Glitch. 

### Features
 - [x] Upload and download any file or folder, regardless of filesize, via a simple graphical interface.
 - [x] Folders are automatically compressed (.tar.bz2) for easy upload.
 - [x] Files and folders larger than the 20MB Discord limit are automatically split when uploaded.
 - [x] Files and folders that are split are automatically joined back together when downloaded. This process _shouldn't_ corrupt any data.
 - [x] Delete files from the record.
 - [x] Status indicator that can show download speed.
 - [ ] PLANNED: Proper config GUI, so you don't have to enter in URLS, tokens, etc. directly into the code.
 - [ ] PLANNED: Upload speed indicator.

### Instructions
 - Instructions in the .py file.
